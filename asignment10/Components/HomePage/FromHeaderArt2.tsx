              To ensure the quality and authenticity of all items on our
              marketplace, we only allow a select group of stores and sellers
              that have passed our verification process, to sell on our
              platform. We encourage you to request to become a seller by
              filling out all the required information. Weâ€™ll notify you as soon
              as your request has been approved.
